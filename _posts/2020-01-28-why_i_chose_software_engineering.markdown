I have always been intrigued by mechanization.  I have always desired to be able to help make things go smoother and
more quickly.  Not to make life more chaotic but to actually have a life of more intrigue. A life that might be might be called total bliss.  I mean because making things more mechanized is so much fun. That is, in becoming a software engineer we look for ways to solve digital problems. We want to use our know how to make machines work better.  It is a good feeling to be creative and productive at the same time. Software Engineering, I believe, is the most admirable and rewarding of any field out there today. It is fun and you actually want to do it as often as possible.  You want to get better and better at Software Engineering. You are the Captain of Your Own Ship.
