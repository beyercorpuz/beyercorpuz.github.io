Life is good when you are challenged.  You feel so much better about yourself.  Your life has meaning.  You can be challenged both physically and mentally.  However with programming  you  are given certain tools to work with.  These tools and changing all the time.  What I like most is that once we get hold of these tools there is no end to what we can do to affect the world positively.  You have creative license to think and come up with solutions for all types of industries.  You can work in many places.  Your opportunity for employment is unlimited in this IT industry that is constantly growing.

Personally I would enjoy working many places in programming.  Always gaining experience.  However I will try to focus in the Music Industry as I have the most interest in Music Retail and music in general.   If I could focus in music eCommerce I would be happy.  I like to think I am truly promoting music in this way.

I use the NAMM organiztion as the head of music music retail.  There link is provided about and should provide good example of the industry so in need of cutting edge systems engineering.

In sum, I will use all of my life's experience to be the best programmer I can be.  And I have had a lot of experience.  Yet I know for sure systems engineering and consulting will be my terminal profession.  It is where I can do the most justice in the business world and elsewhere.
